## Motivation

A tinder-style app for finding a job could be beneficial for both job seekers and employers. For job seekers, the app would make it easier to find job opportunities that match their skills and interests. They would be able to define their profile and see job listings from companies that are looking for someone with their qualifications. By swiping left or right on a job listing, they could indicate their interest in a particular job, and the company could then contact them if they are interested in pursuing the candidate further.

This type of app could also be beneficial for employers, as it would make it easier for them to find qualified candidates for their open positions. By posting job listings on the app, they could reach a larger pool of potential employees and easily identify those who are interested in their job opportunities. This could save time and resources for the employer, as they would not have to spend as much time and effort on traditional methods of recruiting, such as posting job ads and reviewing resumes.

Overall, a tinder-style job search app could be a useful tool for both job seekers and employers, making it easier for them to find and connect with each other.
